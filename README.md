# Building a new portfolio for my web development/design and art whilst teaching myself NextJS and TypeScript - styled with SCSS modules

## Setup

`npm install`

First, run the development server:

`npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deployed via Vercel
